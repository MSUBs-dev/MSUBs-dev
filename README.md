Hi, Iâ€™m @MSUBs-dev, Eric from the Montana State University Bookstore.  I primarily work in automating repetitive tasks, however I've recently started branching into standalone application development.  Iâ€™m interested in robotics and mechanical design, which is what my Degree is in.  I primarily work in Python, however I have 8 years of Java programming background.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about SLAM, pathfindnig, and various types of machine learning.  And Rust, very slowly...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: erickapalka@montana.edu, or contact the MSU Bookstore in Bozeman MT and ask for the software developer
